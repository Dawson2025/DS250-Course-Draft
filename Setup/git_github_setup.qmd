### Setup Git and GitHub 
#### GitHub will be used for publishing all projects

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer   
    * [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) Installation
        Note: Keep all settings as default during installation
    * [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) Installation  
        Note: Mac users can install git using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `brew install git` in the terminal. You will need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first if you don't have it   

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) Account with your `BYUI-I email`. 
    * Use an [appropriate username](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/83967/does-my-employer-care-about-my-github-username). It will be the name of your public profile and website in Project 6. 
    * If you already have a GitHub account, you can add your BYUI-I email to your existing account. Go to `Settings` -> `Emails` -> `Add email address` and make it your primary email.

1. [Install](https://desktop.github.com/) GitHub Desktop  

1. __Git a Course Work Portfolio in GitHub__

        * __Select `byui-math-dept` as the `Owner` You should have been added to `byui-math-dept` by your teacher if you dont see it ask them to add you. This Org uses SSO with BYUI, if you dont have your BYUI email in your GitHub account you need to add it (account -> settings -> emails -> add email address) If you have performed all these steps and still dont see it look for a badge above `Repository template` that states `Single sign-on to see results in the byui-math-dept organization.` Follow that link to sign in with SSO then you will be able to choose  `byui-math-dept` as the `Owner`__
