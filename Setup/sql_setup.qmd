### SQLITE Setup

There is nothing to download to `setup` SQLITE
This [SQLite Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer) VS Code extension will be helpful to explore the database 


### Downloads

Download this [sqlite db file](/Data/lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite)
Save it in the same place as the `.py` or `.qmd` file created in the next step


### Test Your Setup

Copy the code below and test it in a `.py` file. If everything works you are all set

```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import sqlite3

# %%
# careful to list your path to the file or save it in the same place as your .qmd or .py file
sqlite_file = 'lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)

q = 'SELECT * FROM allstarfull LIMIT 5'
results = pd.read_sql_query(q,con)

results
```

You can see the list of tables available in the database

```python
q = '''
    SELECT * 
    FROM sqlite_master 
    WHERE type='table'
    '''
table = pd.read_sql_query(q,con)
table.filter(['name'])
```
