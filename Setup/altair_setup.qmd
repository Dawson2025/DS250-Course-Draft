### Altair Visualization

We will be using Altair in our course. It is a declarative visualization package in Python that is based on Vega-Lite which leverages the grammar of graphics.

- [User Guide](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
- [Data Visualization Curriculum](https://uwdata.github.io/visualization-curriculum/intro.html) or the [Quarto version](
https://jjallaire.github.io/visualization-curriculum/)
- [P4DS Data Visualization Chapter](https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/data-visualisation.html)


### Rendering Altair Charts in Quarto

We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#figure-size) to render Altair images automagically into our HTML reports.  The process should simply work.  If not, read in the following section if you need to export one of your images as a `.png` or another image format.
