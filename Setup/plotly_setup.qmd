### Plotly Express Visualization

To get started with plotly.express (typically imported as px), we must first install the library in the usual using pip in the VSCode terminal. 

```{python}
pip install plotly.express
```

Next, we load the library into a Python script or notebook.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px
```


This gives us access to all functions and built-in datasets to begin using plotly.express to build visualizations in Python.

### Plotly.Express Basics

The generic syntax of a px graph is `px.graphic_type(dataset, x, y, color, size, title...)`

For an incredibly boring first graph, let's try:

```{python}
px.scatter(x = [7,8,9,10,11,12], y = [6,5,4,3,2,1], title = "We did it!")
```
