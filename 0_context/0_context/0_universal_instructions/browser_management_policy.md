# Browser Management Policy for AI Automation

## Overview

This document establishes the default behavior for browser automation tasks performed by AI assistants in the DS250-Course-Draft project.

## Default Behavior: Keep Browsers Open

**CRITICAL RULE**: When AI automates browser tasks, browser instances MUST remain open after completion.

### Scope
- Applies to all browser automation: Chromium, Playwright, Chrome DevTools
- Browsers should stay open for user review and verification
- Only close browsers if explicitly requested by user

### Implementation
- General automation: Launch with `&` (background), leave running
- Use separate user data directories for multiple instances
- Preserve browser state for ongoing work

## Exception: Testing

**Testing Environment**: When running automated tests, browser instances SHOULD close after tests complete.

### Rationale
- Keeps the testing environment clean
- Prevents resource accumulation during test runs
- Maintains isolation between test sessions

### Implementation
- Test scripts should include `driver.quit()` or equivalent cleanup
- Use explicit close/quit commands in test cleanup
- Ensure proper resource management

## Commands Reference

### General Automation
```bash
# Launch browser and keep open
chromium --user-data-dir="/tmp/chromium-instance1" file.html &

# Multiple instances
chromium --user-data-dir="/tmp/chromium-instance2" &
```

### Testing (with cleanup)
```python
# Include in test scripts
driver.quit()  # Close browser after tests
```

## Policy Enforcement

- ✅ Do NOT close any Chromium instances during task execution
- ✅ Do NOT close any Chromium instances after task completion  
- ✅ Leave all browser windows open for user review and verification
- ✅ This is the DEFAULT BEHAVIOR for all future browser automation tasks
- ✅ EXCEPTION: Close browsers after automated testing is complete
- ✅ Only close browsers if explicitly requested by user

## Examples

### Correct Usage
- Opening templates for review → Keep browser open
- Canvas authentication → Keep browser open  
- Data extraction → Keep browser open
- Screenshot capture → Keep browser open

### Testing Exception
- Unit tests → Close browser after completion
- Integration tests → Close browser after completion
- Performance tests → Close browser after completion
