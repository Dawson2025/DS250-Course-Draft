# Archive Entry: Unit_2 Template Text Sections Updated with Data Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Time:** 18:00:00  
**Type:** Content Enhancement

## Summary

Replaced generic methodology descriptions with real data analysis in all Unit_2 assignment templates. Text sections now analyze actual results from code execution rather than explaining how calculations work.

## What Changed

### Process
1. Rendered all 4 templates to HTML using `quarto render`
2. Opened rendered HTML files in browser using Chrome DevTools
3. Extracted actual table data and visualization information
4. Analyzed patterns, trends, and insights from real results
5. Rewrote text sections to provide data-driven analysis

### Files Modified

1. **Templates/Unit_2/assignment_1/unit2_task1_template.qmd**
   - Line 51 (Question 1): Now analyzes actual results showing all 5 players with 1.000 BA (single at-bat performances from 1923-2019)
   - Line 75 (Question 2): Analyzes realistic BA range (0.571-0.643) with specific players (nymanny01, carsoma01, etc.) and years
   - Line 99 (Question 3): Analyzes career statistics (Ty Cobb 0.366, etc.) with historical context about early 20th century players

2. **Templates/Unit_2/assignment_2/unit2_task2_template.qmd**
   - Line 51 (Question 1): Now explains how pandas validation matches SQL results with specific data points
   - Line 84 (Question 2): Analyzes career batting averages with specific players and statistical insights about rarity of sustained excellence

3. **Templates/Unit_2/assignment_3/unit2_task3_validation_template.qmd**
   - Line 52 (Question 1): Analyzes BYU-Idaho player salary data (30 records, primarily lindsma01, salary progression from $380K to $4M)
   - Line 90 (Question 2): Analyzes Yankees/Red Sox salary comparison data (1985-2016, $435K to $5-6M range)
   - Line 143 (Analysis section): Detailed analysis of visualization showing parallel salary growth, 10-15x increase, correlation with competitive success

4. **Templates/Unit_2/assignment_4/unit2_task3_template.qmd**
   - Line 56 (Question 1): Analyzes top 10 longest careers (Nick Altrock 36 years, Jim O'Rourke 33, etc.) with historical context

## Key Improvements

### Before (Methodology Description)
- "Batting average is calculated as hits divided by at-bats..."
- "This task demonstrates joining tables using pandas..."
- Generic explanations of what the code does

### After (Data Analysis)
- "The results reveal an interesting pattern: all five top players achieved a perfect 1.000 batting average..."
- "Our analysis identified 30 salary records for BYU-Idaho alumni..."
- Specific observations from actual data results
- Patterns and trends evident in tables and visualizations
- Historical context and statistical insights

## Data Insights Captured

### Assignment 1
- Single at-bat perfect averages span 1923-2019
- Realistic averages (≥10 AB) range 0.571-0.643
- Career greats (Cobb, Hornsby) achieved 0.355-0.366 averages

### Assignment 2
- Pandas validation confirms SQL results exactly
- Career averages demonstrate rarity of sustained excellence

### Assignment 3
- BYU-Idaho player (lindsma01) salary progression: $380K→$4M
- Yankees/Red Sox salaries: $435K (1985) → $5-6M (2016), 10-15x increase

### Assignment 4
- Top longevity: 28-36 year careers
- Historical concentration in early baseball eras

## Impact

- **Student Learning**: Templates now demonstrate proper data analysis writing style
- **Report Quality**: Shows how to analyze results rather than just describe methodology
- **Real Data**: Uses actual values and patterns from the Lahman database
- **Visualization Analysis**: Includes specific insights from charts and graphs
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates consulting-report style data interpretation
