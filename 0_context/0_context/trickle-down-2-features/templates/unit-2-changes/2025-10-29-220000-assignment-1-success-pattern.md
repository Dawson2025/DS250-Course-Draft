# Archive Entry: Assignment 1 Success Pattern Documented

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Time:** 22:00:00  
**Type:** Best Practices Documentation

## Summary

Documented the successful approach used in Unit_2 Assignment 1 (`unit2_task1_template.qmd`) to establish best practices for template completion. This assignment serves as the reference model for SQL-based template implementations.

## What Made Assignment 1 Successful

### 1. SQL Query Best Practices

**Safe Division Handling:**
```python
CAST(H AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(AB, 0) AS batting_avg
```
- Uses `NULLIF(AB, 0)` to prevent division by zero errors
- Explicitly casts integers to FLOAT for decimal results
- Clear, readable calculation in SQL

**Proper Aggregation:**
```sql
SELECT playerID, SUM(H) AS total_hits, SUM(AB) AS total_at_bats
FROM batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING SUM(AB) >= 100
ORDER BY career_batting_avg DESC, playerID ASC
```
- Correctly uses GROUP BY for aggregating across years
- Uses HAVING (not WHERE) for filtering aggregated results
- Calculates aggregations before applying filters

**Correct Ordering:**
```sql
ORDER BY batting_avg DESC, playerID ASC
```
- Primary sort descending for top values
- Secondary sort ascending for consistent alphabetical order
- Clear, explicit ordering logic

### 2. Code Quality Standards

**Slack Policy Compliance:**
```python
result1 = pd.read_sql_query(query1, con)
print(result1.head(5))  # âœ… Correct
```
- Always uses `.head()` instead of printing full dataframes
- Complies with Slack announcement requirements
- Limits output to what's needed in report

**Clear Query Structure:**
- Multi-line SQL queries for readability
- Descriptive alias names (`batting_avg` not `ba`)
- Comments explaining query purpose
- Separate query variables for clarity

**Database Path:**
```python
sqlite_file = '/home/dawson/code/DS250-Course-Draft/Data/lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'
# Database is located in the Data directory (absolute path)
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)
```
- Absolute path clearly documented
- Comment explaining path purpose
- Works reliably in development environment

### 3. Text Analysis Based on Real Data

**Specific Value References:**
- Mentions specific player IDs: `abramge01`, `alanirj01`, `nymanny01`, `carsoma01`
- Cites specific years: 1923, 2019, 1974, 2013, 1910
- Provides exact percentages: 0.643 (64.3%), 0.636 (63.6%), 0.600 (60.0%)

**Pattern Identification:**
- Identifies that all top 5 players achieved perfect 1.000 averages (Question 1)
- Notes the 95-year span from 1923 to 2019
- Recognizes small sample size limitations
- Explains why minimum at-bat thresholds matter

**Historical Context:**
- Compares single-season vs. career statistics
- Notes that career leaders (Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby) played in early 20th century
- Provides context for era differences

**Progressive Analysis:**
- Question 1: Notes perfect averages but small samples
- Question 2: Shows realistic averages with higher thresholds
- Question 3: Demonstrates career consistency over thousands of at-bats
- Each analysis builds on previous observations

### 4. Complete Solution Structure

**For Each Question:**
1. Question prompt (bold, clear instructions)
2. Text analysis (paragraph based on actual results)
3. Code block with:
   - Comment explaining query purpose
   - Complete SQL query
   - Execution with pandas
   - Display with `.head()`

**Code Execution Flow:**
```python
# 1. Setup (top of file)
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
sqlite_file = '...'
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)

# 2. Per-Question Pattern
query = """SQL HERE"""
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, con)
print(result.head(5))
```

### 5. Progressive Complexity

**Question 1** (Simple):
- Single year, single table
- Basic WHERE filter
- Simple calculation

**Question 2** (Moderate):
- Same structure, stricter filter
- Shows impact of threshold on results

**Question 3** (Complex):
- Multi-year aggregation with GROUP BY
- HAVING clause for aggregated filtering
- SUM calculations across years
- Demonstrates career-level analysis

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Pedagogical Value**: Students see complete, working examples
2. **Best Practices**: Demonstrates proper SQL techniques
3. **Policy Compliance**: Follows all Slack-announced requirements
4. **Data Analysis**: Real analysis based on actual results, not generic methodology
5. **Completeness**: Every question has both code and explanation
6. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes updates easy
7. **Testing**: Code runs successfully and displays correct results

## Replicable Pattern

This success pattern can be applied to:
- Other SQL-based assignments
- Pandas-based assignments (using similar structure)
- Visualization assignments (adding plot code after query)
- Multi-step analysis tasks

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always use safe division** (NULLIF for denominators)
2. **Use .head() for display** (Slack policy)
3. **Write analysis from actual results** (not generic methodology)
4. **Reference specific values** (player IDs, years, percentages)
5. **Build complexity progressively** (simple to complex)
6. **Document database paths** (absolute or relative with comments)
7. **Complete solutions** (code + explanation for every question)
