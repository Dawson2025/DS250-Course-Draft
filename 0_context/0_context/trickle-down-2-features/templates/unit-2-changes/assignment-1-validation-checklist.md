# Assignment 1 Template Validation Checklist

**Reference Template**: `Templates/Unit_2/assignment_1/unit2_task1_template.qmd`

This checklist documents what was done correctly in Assignment 1 and serves as a validation tool for similar template completions.

## Pre-Completion Checks

- [ ] Read the assignment project file completely
- [ ] Understand all question requirements
- [ ] Verify database location and path
- [ ] Check Slack announcements for policy requirements
- [ ] Review similar completed templates if available

## SQL Query Quality

### Query Structure
- [x] Uses `CAST(... AS FLOAT)` for decimal calculations
- [x] Uses `NULLIF(denominator, 0)` to prevent division by zero
- [x] Includes `ORDER BY` with DESC/ASC as appropriate
- [x] Uses `LIMIT` to restrict results to requested count
- [x] For aggregations: Uses `GROUP BY` correctly
- [x] For aggregated filters: Uses `HAVING` (not WHERE)
- [x] Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`) applied before filtering

### Code Organization
- [x] SQL queries stored in string variables (`query1`, `query2`, etc.)
- [x] Multi-line SQL for readability
- [x] Comments explaining query purpose above each query
- [x] Descriptive alias names (`batting_avg`, `career_batting_avg`)
- [x] Consistent formatting and indentation

## Policy Compliance

### Slack Policy Requirements
- [x] Uses `.head()` method for displaying dataframes
- [ ] Does NOT print entire dataframes (`.head()` only)
- [x] Uses `lets_plot` for visualizations (if applicable)
- [ ] Does NOT use matplotlib (checked: N/A for Assignment 1)

### Display Standards
- [x] Results displayed with `print(result.head(5))`
- [x] Output matches question requirements (top 5, top 10, etc.)
- [x] No unnecessary verbosity in output

## Database Configuration

### Path Setup
- [x] Database path clearly defined
- [x] Path documented with comment
- [x] Connection created with `sqlite3.connect()`
- [x] Connection reused across queries (efficient)

**Assignment 1 Approach:**
```python
sqlite_file = '/home/dawson/code/DS250-Course-Draft/Data/lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'
# Database is located in the Data directory (absolute path)
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)
```

## Text Analysis Quality

### Specificity
- [x] References specific player IDs from results
- [x] Mentions specific years from data
- [x] Provides exact percentages or values
- [x] Identifies patterns in the results
- [x] Notes sample size limitations where relevant

**Assignment 1 Examples:**
- ✅ "all five top players achieved a perfect 1.000 batting average"
- ✅ "span over 95 years, from 1923 (abramge01) to 2019 (alanirj01)"
- ✅ "ranging from 0.571 to 0.643 (57.1% to 64.3%)"
- ✅ "Ty Cobb (cobbty01) leads with a career average of 0.366"

### Analysis Depth
- [x] Explains what the results show (not just methodology)
- [x] Provides context (historical, statistical, practical)
- [x] Compares results across questions when relevant
- [x] Identifies limitations or caveats
- [x] Draws meaningful insights from data

**Assignment 1 Examples:**
- ✅ "While statistically perfect, these results represent very small sample sizes"
- ✅ "This underscores why minimum at-bat thresholds are important"
- ✅ "All five players in the top tier achieved career averages between 0.355 and 0.366"
- ✅ "suggesting the importance of historical context when comparing career achievements"

## Code Execution

### Functionality
- [x] Code runs without errors
- [x] SQL queries return expected results
- [x] Results match question requirements
- [x] All three questions have complete solutions

### Testing Results (Assignment 1)
- [x] Question 1: Returns top 5 players with 1+ at-bats (perfect 1.000 averages)
- [x] Question 2: Returns top 5 players with 10+ at-bats (realistic averages 0.571-0.643)
- [x] Question 3: Returns top 5 career averages with 100+ at-bats (0.355-0.366 range)

## Progressive Complexity

- [x] Question 1: Simple query (single year, basic WHERE)
- [x] Question 2: Similar query with stricter filter
- [x] Question 3: Complex aggregation (GROUP BY, SUM, HAVING)

## Template Structure

### YAML Frontmatter
- [x] Title matches assignment
- [x] Format includes `self-contained: true`
- [x] Code folding enabled (`code-fold: true`)
- [x] Appropriate page layout settings

### Section Organization
- [x] Setup/imports at top
- [x] Database connection established early
- [x] Each question has:
  - Bold question prompt
  - Text analysis paragraph
  - Code block with solution

### Code Blocks
- [x] Python code blocks marked with `{python}`
- [x] Code is executable
- [x] Comments explain complex operations
- [x] Output displays correctly when rendered

## File Location

- [x] Template in correct directory: `Templates/Unit_2/assignment_1/`
- [x] Matches project file location: `Projects/Unit_2/assignment_1/`
- [x] Filename follows convention: `unit2_task1_template.qmd`

## Documentation

### In-Code Documentation
- [x] Import statements commented if needed
- [x] Database path has explanatory comment
- [x] Each query has purpose comment
- [x] Complex SQL operations explained

### External Documentation
- [x] Approach documented in project instructions
- [x] Success pattern archived
- [x] Validation checklist created (this file)

## Rendering Verification

- [x] Template renders to HTML without errors
- [x] All code cells execute successfully
- [x] Results display correctly
- [x] Text sections are readable and well-formatted
- [x] Code folding works (code hidden by default)
- [x] Output is self-contained HTML

## Success Criteria Summary

**Assignment 1 met all criteria:**
- ✅ SQL queries use best practices (CAST, NULLIF, proper ordering)
- ✅ Policy compliant (.head() usage, lets_plot)
- ✅ Database properly configured
- ✅ Text analysis based on actual results with specific values
- ✅ Complete solutions for all questions
- ✅ Progressive complexity from simple to advanced
- ✅ Code runs successfully and renders correctly

## Applying This Pattern

When completing similar SQL-based templates:
1. Follow the SQL best practices outlined
2. Ensure Slack policy compliance
3. Write text analysis after running code and seeing actual results
4. Reference specific values from the data
5. Build complexity progressively across questions
6. Test rendering and execution before completion
