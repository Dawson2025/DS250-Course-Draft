# Archive Entry: Unit_2 GitHub Pages Link Verification

**Date**: 2025-10-29 15:55:00  
**AI Agent**: Claude Code (Cursor)  
**Related Task/Issue**: Verify Unit_2 files match the GitHub Pages versions linked from Canvas assignments

## Change Summary

Verified that all 4 files in Projects/Unit_2 match the exact content from the GitHub Pages site (https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/) that each Canvas assignment links to.

## Files Changed

None - this was a verification activity. All files already matched correctly.

## Details

### Why This Change Was Made

User requested verification that Unit_2 folder files correspond to the GitHub Pages links embedded in each Canvas assignment. Each Canvas assignment has an iframe or link pointing to a specific page on the GitHub Pages site.

### Canvas → GitHub Pages → Local File Mapping Verified

1. **Assignment 15477823** (Unit 2 Task 1: Batting Averages)
   - Canvas links to: `https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Projects/unit2_task1.html`
   - Local file: `Projects/Unit_2/unit2_task1.qmd`
   - **Status**: ✓ Matches perfectly

2. **Assignment 15477825** (Unit 2 Task 2: Basic aggregation and wrangling)
   - Canvas links to: `https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Projects/unit2_task2.html`
   - Local file: `Projects/Unit_2/unit2_task2.qmd`
   - **Status**: ✓ Matches perfectly

3. **Assignment 15477827** (Unit 2 Task 3: Joins)
   - Canvas links to: `https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Projects/unit2_task3_validation_in_py.html`
   - Local file: `Projects/Unit_2/unit2_task3_validation_in_py.qmd`
   - **Status**: ✓ Matches perfectly

4. **Assignment 15477821** (Unit 2 STRETCH: Longevity / Task 4: Longevity of Players)
   - Canvas links to: `https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Projects/unit2_task3.html`
   - Local file: `Projects/Unit_2/unit2_task3.qmd`
   - **Status**: ✓ Matches perfectly

### Verification Method

1. Extracted GitHub Pages URLs from Canvas assignment iframes/browser snapshots
2. Used Tavily web extraction to retrieve full content from all 4 GitHub Pages URLs
3. Read all 4 local `.qmd` files in Projects/Unit_2/
4. Compared content, structure, sections, and requirements
5. Verified all match between GitHub Pages and local files

### Verification Result

**All 4 files are correct and match their corresponding GitHub Pages versions.**

- Content structure: ✓ Matches
- Section headings: ✓ Matches  
- Task requirements: ✓ Matches
- Links and references: ✓ Matches
- Template references: ✓ Matches

No changes were needed - the files were already correctly aligned with the GitHub Pages site.
