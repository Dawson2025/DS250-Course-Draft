**Date**: 2025-10-29 16:04:30  
**AI Agent**: Claude Code (Cursor)  
**Related Task/Issue**: Update Templates/Unit_2/ templates to match exact versions from GitHub Pages site

## Change Summary

Replaced all 4 templates in `Templates/Unit_2/` with the exact versions downloaded directly from GitHub Pages site (https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Templates/) to ensure local templates match what students see on the published site.

## Files Changed

- `Templates/Unit_2/unit2_task1_template.qmd` - **REPLACED**: Downloaded from GitHub Pages
- `Templates/Unit_2/unit2_task2_template.qmd` - **REPLACED**: Downloaded from GitHub Pages
- `Templates/Unit_2/unit2_task3_validation_template.qmd` - **REPLACED**: Downloaded from GitHub Pages
- `Templates/Unit_2/unit2_task3_template.qmd` - **REPLACED**: Downloaded from GitHub Pages

## Details

### Why This Change Was Made

User confirmed the template URLs from GitHub Pages and requested verification. After downloading and comparing, local templates were replaced with exact GitHub Pages versions to ensure students using the templates see the same content as what's published on the site.

### Previous State

- Templates were copied from local `Templates/` root directory
- Local templates may have differed from GitHub Pages versions
- Potential inconsistency between what students download and what's on the site

### New State

- All 4 templates downloaded directly from GitHub Pages URLs:
  1. https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Templates/unit2_task1_template.qmd
  2. https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Templates/unit2_task2_template.qmd
  3. https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Templates/unit2_task3_validation_template.qmd
  4. https://byuidatascience.github.io/DS250-Course-Draft/Templates/unit2_task3_template.qmd

- Templates now exactly match GitHub Pages published versions
- File sizes after update:
  - unit2_task1_template.qmd: 1.9K
  - unit2_task2_template.qmd: 2.0K
  - unit2_task3_validation_template.qmd: 2.3K
  - unit2_task3_template.qmd: 1.2K

### Important Note on Template Content

**Note**: The GitHub Pages templates contain what appear to be incorrect titles/subtitles:
- `unit2_task1_template.qmd` has subtitle "Unit 2 Task 2" (should be "Unit 2 Task 1")
- `unit2_task2_template.qmd` has subtitle "Unit 2 Task 3" (should be "Unit 2 Task 2")

However, since these are the official published versions on GitHub Pages, they were downloaded as-is to maintain consistency with the public site. The templates match exactly what students will download from the GitHub Pages links.

### Impact

- Templates in `Templates/Unit_2/` now match GitHub Pages exactly
- No discrepancies between local and published versions
- Students using templates from either location will see identical content
- Better alignment with official course materials
