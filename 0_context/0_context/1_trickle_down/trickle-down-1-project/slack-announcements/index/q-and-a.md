## Unit 1 Questions

### Task 1, Question 5: Gender Identification
- **Asked By**: Mary Palmer
- **Time**: October 2025, 1:25 PM
- **Question**: How to find most common female name in Utah when dataset has no gender column?
- **Answer** (David Palmer, 1:32 PM):
  > That is correct. There is some ambiguity and a need to apply some human judgement. When you scan the sorted table to look at the most common names in Utah, you should be able to find the first one that seems predominantly female as your answer.
- **Impact**: Clarifies Unit 1 Task 1 assignment approach
- **Key Point**: Requires human judgment - no automated gender detection
