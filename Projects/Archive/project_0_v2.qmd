### Background

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

We will complete six projects during the semester that each take about two weeks (four days of class).  On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page. 

This first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.
:::

Python and VS Code are tools commonly used in the field of data science. During our first two days of class we will get VS Code prepped for data science programming. Completing Project 0 will set you up for success the rest of the semester.


### Data

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
Every data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have __'Download'__ and __'Information'__ links like the ones below.
:::

__Download:__ [mpg data](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/raw/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv)   
__Information:__ [Data description](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/blob/master/data.md#fuel-economy-data-from-1999-to-2008-for-38-popular-models-of-cars)


### Readings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
The Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.  

We recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding **before the first day of each project**.  You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.
:::

The readings listed below are required for the first two days of class.

- [Course Setup](../setup.qmd)
- [Learn about VS Code](../Course%20Materials/vs_code.qmd)
- [Learn about Plotly Express](../Course%20Materials/plotly_express.qmd)
- [Learn about our Book Python for Data Science](../Course%20Materials/python.qmd)
- [Quarto Instructional Template for DS](../Templates/ds250_project_template.qmd)
- [Python for Data Science (P4DS): Introduction](https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/introduction.html)

#### Optional References

- [VS Code user interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) 
- [Reading Technical Documentation](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse450-course/course/reading-technical-documentation.html)


### Questions and Tasks

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
This section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a report, pushed to GitHub and a URL submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.  
:::

In the DS 250 folder of the Course Work Portfolio, edit the `Project0.qmd` quarto file to complete the following:  

1. __Finish the readings, setup, and be prepared with any questions to get your environment working smoothly (class for on-campus and Slack for online)__  
1. __In VS Code, create the example chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook. (Note: you will be using Plotly Express to display the chart instead of Altair which is used in the book)__  
1. __Your final report should also include the table created from the following (assuming you have `mpg` from question 2)__  
  ```python
  (mpg
    .head(5)
    .filter(["manufacturer", "model","year", "hwy"])
  )
  ```  
4. __Your portfolio should include your updated resume in markdown language as part of the [Git and Github Setup](../Setup/git_github_setup.qmd) using the `resume.qmd` file in the portfolio__  


### Deliverables:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
Deliverables are “the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project”. In this class the deliverable for each project is a GitHub published report created using Quarto files. This final section will be the same for each project. 
:::

_Use this [template](/Templates/ds250_project_template_clean.qmd) to submit your Client Report. The template has two sections:_

1. _A short elevator pitch that highlights key values or metrics from the results. Describing these key insights to interest or hook the reader to want to read more about your work. The writing style should be more technical with some creative elements. Do not summarize what you did._  
2. _Answers to the questions | tasks. Each answer should include a written description of your results, code cells with comments, charts, and/or tables._  

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
_Your report should be written in quarto markdown files and pushed to GitHub which will render it to HTML. Submit a URL of the rendered project in Canvas. (Do not submit the URL to the GitHub `.qmd` file)_
