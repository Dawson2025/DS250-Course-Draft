### Background

When you hear the word “relationship” what is the first thing that comes to mind? Probably not baseball. But a relationship is simply a way to describe how two or more objects are connected. There are many relationships in baseball such as those between teams and managers, players and salaries, even stadiums and concession prices. 

The graphs on [Data Visualizations from Best Tickets](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804101201/http://www.besttickets.com/blog/mlb-players-census/) show many other relationships that exist in baseball.


### Client Request

For this project, the Client wants SQL queries that they can use to retrieve data for use on their website without needing Python. They would also like to see the results in Lets-Plot charts.


### Data

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
This project will use the Lahman Baseball Database. In order to complete this project, you will need to download the database and save it inside the DS250 folder (hopefully you have a folder dedicated to this class) next to the .qmd file you will be using for this assignment. Note: Right click the __'Download'__ link and select "Save Link As" to download the data to your computer.
:::

__Download:__ [lahmansbaseballdb](/Data/lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite)  
__Information:__ [Lahman Data Dictionary](/Data/readme2014.txt)  
__Setup Instructions:__ [See SQL Setup](/Setup/sql_setup.qmd)


### Readings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
Complete these readings before we cover the material in class. This will help you retain the material and make the class period more engaging - not less. 

In other words, if an assignment is due on Wednesday, we will cover the material needed to complete the assignment on Tuesday. Therefore, you should complete the readings on Monday (or anytime before class on Tuesday).
