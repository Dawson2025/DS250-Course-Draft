### Background

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

We will complete six projects during the semester that each take about two weeks (four days of class).  On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project **(for a total of 8 hours per project)**. The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page. 

This first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.
:::

Python and VS Code are tools commonly used in the field of data science. During our first two days of class we will get VS Code prepped for data science programming. Completing Project 0 will set you up for success the rest of the semester.


### Data

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Every data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have __'Download'__ and __'Information'__ links like the ones below.
:::

__Download:__ [penguins data](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html#the-penguins-data-frame)   


### Readings

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
The Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.  

We recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding **before the first day of each project**.  You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.
:::

The readings listed below are required for the first two days of class.

- [Course Setup](../setup.qmd) (Do)

- [P4DS: CH31 Quarto](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/quarto.html) (Skim)
- [Quarto Instructional Template for DS](../Templates/ds250_project_template.qmd) (Read)


#### Optional References
- [Learn about VS Code](../Course%20Materials/vs_code.qmd)
- [VS Code user interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) 
- [Reading Technical Documentation](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse450-course/course/reading-technical-documentation.html)


### Questions and Tasks

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
This section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a report, pushed to GitHub and a URL submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.  
:::

In the DS 250 folder of the Course Work Portfolio, edit the `Project0.qmd` quarto file to build a report that includes the following:  

1. __Finish the [Course Setup](../setup.qmd), and post any questions to getting your environment working smoothly in your course Slack channel__  
1. __Recreate the example chart from [PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html) of the textbook.__
1. __Include the table created from [PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html) used to create the above chart__  
1. __Update the `_quarto.yml` file in course work portfolio:__
    a. update the `title` to includ your name
    b. update the `site url` to your published site url (this will be in the deployment section in GitHub)
    c. update the `repo-url` to your GitHub repository url
    d. update the `issue-url` to your GitHub issue url (its the same as the repo url but with `/issues/new` at the end)
    e. update the `page-footer` `left` to include your name
    f. update the `page-footer` `right` `href` to include your LinkedIn url (optional)
1. __Update the `resume.qmd` file in course work portfolio to include your updated resume using markdown. See [P4DS: CH30 Markdown](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/markdown.html)__  


### Submission:
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
When you have completed the report, you will need to follow this process to submit your work:

1. __Before you begin__ you must `Click` the link in the email from GitHub to join your class group in the `BYUI-math-dept` org in GitHub. (If you have not received an email, please DM your teacher in Slack, this invitation does expire after 7 days so please dont delay in accepting the invitation)
1. Have the Course Work Portfolio open in VS Code
1. Click `Termanal` in VS Code and open a new terminal
1. In the terminal, type `quarto render` and press enter
    a. This will render the entire course work portfolio into `HTML` files
    b. This will move all those files into the `docs` folder
    c. This can take a few minutes to complete
    d. If there is an error in any cell of the quarto files, the rendering will stop and you will need to fix the error before rendering again (if you get stuck post your error in Slack)
1. Once the report is rendered, open the `GitHub Desktop` application
1. Type a summary of the changes in the `Summary` box
1. Click `Commit to main` blue button in the bottom left corner
1. Click `Push origin` blue button in the middle right of the screen
:::

### Deliverables:

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Deliverables are “the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project”. In this class the deliverable for each project is a GitHub published report created using Quarto files. This final section will be the same for each project. 
:::

_Use this [template](../Templates/ds250_project_template.qmd) to submit your Client Report. The template has two sections:_

1. _A short elevator pitch that highlights key values or metrics from the results. Describing these key insights to interest or hook the reader to want to read more about your work. The writing style should be more technical with some creative elements. Do not summarize what you did._  
1. _Answers to the questions | tasks. Each should include a written description of your results, code cells with comments, charts and/or tables._  
1. _A short __summary of work must__ be submitted in the comments in Canvas wwhen you submit the URL. Rate your own work on a scale of 1-5. 1 being poor and 5 being excellent. Include a short description of why you rated your work the way you did._

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
_Your report should be written in quarto markdown files and pushed to GitHub. Submit a URL of the rendered project in Canvas. (Do not submit the URL to the GitHub `.qmd` file)_  
:::


### Feedback:
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
You will recieve feedback and/or coaching notes in the form of a GitHub issue. You will need to address the feedback, re-render and resubmit the project, and mark the GitHub issue as closed.
:::

### Resubmission:
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
You will have __one__ opportunity to resubmit the project after you have received feedback. The window for the resubmission will be open through the __Wednesday__ following the due date of the project. Therefore it is recomended that you turn in a draft of the project early on the __Thursday__ before the due date to ensure you have time to address any feedback and resubmit the project. It is acceptable to turn in a draft that is only 80% complete. This will allow you to get feedback on the majority of the project and then focus on the final details. The closer to that Thursday you turn in the draft the more feedback and coaching you will recieve.
