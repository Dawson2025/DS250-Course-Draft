### Background

Early in prehistory, some descriptive names began to be used again and again until they formed a name pool for a particular culture. Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children. 

With the rise of Christianity, certain trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today, in various forms. These were spread by early missionaries throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.  

By the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, which were a combination of native names and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native.

### Client Request

This csv file contains the number of times a name was given to a child in a specific year. The Client has a passion for names throughout history. They would like to know how the usage of names has changed over time. They are particularly interested in the names Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul. They would also like to know how the usage of a name from a famous movie has changed over time.


### Data

Every data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have __'URL'__ and __'Information'__ links like the ones below. Right click the __'URL'__ link and select "Copy Link". You can use that copied URL in your code to read in the data. This is the preferred method to get data into your report as you will be publishing your report to GitHub. If you choose to download the data file to your computer you will need to save it in the same folder as your quarto file for the assignment in order for it to work correclty in GitHub. 


__URL:__ [names_year.csv](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv)

### Questions and Tasks

Here is an example Stretch question(s) for this project. You can may propose your own idea for a stretch task that you are interested in that would take a similar level of effort and practice a similar set of skills. If you propose a different task, be sure to get it approved by your instructor first. 

1. __Reproduce the chart Elliot using the data from the `names_year.csv` file. If, after a couple of hours, you can get the chart close, but not exactly the same, that is okay. You will learn more to the degree you push yourself.__

Note: There is no template for this task. You will have to create a new file from scratch as part of this stretch.

### Submission:

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
When you have completed the report, you will need to follow this process to submit your work:

1. Have the assignment open in VS Code and nothing else
1. Click `Preview Button` in VS Code in the top right of the screen
    a. This will render the file but also the entire course work portfolio into `HTML` files for review
    b. Confirm everything displays as you would like it to
    c. How you see it will be how it is viewed for grading
    d. If there is an error in any cell of the quarto files, the rendering will stop and you will need to fix the error before rendering again (if you get stuck post your error in Slack)
1. Once the report is confirmed close the preview and open a VS Code `Terminal`
    a. click `Terminal` in the top menu bar and then `New Terminal`
1. Type the following in the terminal `quarto render `
    a. Then drag and drop the assignment into the terminal, this will add the file path to the terminal command
    a. Press Enter
1. This will render the project into a `HTML` file in the same location as the `.qmd` file
1. To locate the file in VS Code
    a. Right click on the file in the file explorer and select `Reveal in File Explorer`(Win) or `Reveal in Finder`(Mac)
1. Upload `HTML` file into Canvas

### Deliverables:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
Deliverables are “the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project”. In this class the deliverable for each project is a .html file report created using Quarto files. This final section will be the same for each project. 
:::

No template is provided. Create a new quarto file for this assignment. It is part of stretching yourself.
 
1. _Answers to the questions | tasks._  

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
_Your report should be written in quarto markdown files and rendered to an HTML File. Upload the HTML file in Canvas. (Do not submit the `.qmd` file)_
