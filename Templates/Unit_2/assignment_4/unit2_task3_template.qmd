## QUESTION 1

__Identify the top 10 players with the longest careers. Include their:__

    - playerID
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - career_length

The analysis reveals exceptional career longevity, with the top 10 players spanning 28-36 seasons in Major League Baseball. Nick Altrock leads with an extraordinary 36-year career, followed by Jim O'Rourke at 33 years and Minnie Minoso at 32 years. Notably, several players achieved 28-year careersâ€”including Nolan Ryan, one of the most celebrated pitchers in baseball history, along with Hughie Jennings and Johnny Evers. These exceptionally long careers span from the late 19th century (starting careers in the 1870s-1880s) to modern times (Ryan's career extended into the 1990s). Such longevity requires not just exceptional talent but remarkable physical durability and adaptability to changes in the game over decades. The concentration of these careers in earlier baseball eras suggests that modern specialization and physical demands may make 30+ year careers even rarer today.

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
# First, get player names from people table
q_people = """SELECT playerID, nameFirst as first_name, nameLast as last_name
              FROM people
           """
people = pd.read_sql_query(q_people, con)

# Get batting data to calculate career span (first year to last year)
q_batting = """SELECT playerID, yearID
               FROM batting
               GROUP BY playerID, yearID
            """
batting_years = pd.read_sql_query(q_batting, con)

# Calculate career length for each player
career_lengths = batting_years.groupby('playerID').agg({
    'yearID': ['min', 'max']
}).reset_index()

career_lengths.columns = ['playerID', 'first_year', 'last_year']
career_lengths['career_length'] = career_lengths['last_year'] - career_lengths['first_year'] + 1

# Merge with people table to get names
result = pd.merge(
    career_lengths[['playerID', 'career_length']],
    people[['playerID', 'first_name', 'last_name']],
    on='playerID',
    how='inner'
)

# Sort by career_length descending and select top 10
top10_longest_careers = result.sort_values('career_length', ascending=False).head(10)

# Select columns in the required order
final_result = top10_longest_careers[['playerID', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'career_length']].copy()

print("Top 10 Players with Longest MLB Careers:")
print(final_result)
