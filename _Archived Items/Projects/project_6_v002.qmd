### Background

GitHub is an online platform where data scientists and developers can communicate and share work. It has also morphed into a tool to house all your work in a portfolio. Think about an Art student and how they have to develop their portfolio of various skills they have across the art classes. Similarly you will want to showcase you skillset across the Data Science skillsets. 

As students, you will want to curate your creative work on GitHub using a program called Git. GitHub is the place to share your original work, **not your homework assignments**. The reading assignments will dive deaper into what to include in your portfolio and what not to include.

Many people store their personal websites, blogs, and project websites on GitHub.  Our textbook and course are hosted on GitHub, and you can see [J. Hathaway's](http://jhathaway.io/) or [Ryan Hafen's](https://ryanhafen.com/) personal Data Science websites that are hosted on GitHub as well. 

For this project, you will be making a public website that is a data science portfolio that will be hosted on GitHub. Your Resume (from project 0) will be one section of your portfolio/website. You should also post Data Science Society projects, personal projects, and any other data science related work you have done outside of class.
