:::
````
Surround ```chunks of code``` with ``` or a single line of `code` with `
Follow the first set of ``` with the words `python`

```python
# setup
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
```
````

<br>

```python
# setup

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
```

:::

## Text Basics
### Horizontal Lines

Add horizontal lines with either three `---`, `***`, or `___`
But you also need blank lines above and below them

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Expand To See The Results"}

:::

### Headers
````
# Level 1 Header
## Level 2 Header
### Level 3 Header
#### Level 4 Header
##### Level 5 Header
###### Level 6 Header
````
Note: only top 3 Levels of Headers will automatically generate a table of contents.<br> Also Level 2 will automatically add a line underneath it.

### Italics and Bold
````
_italics_ use one `_`
you can also use _mid_ sentence

__bold__ use two `__`
you can also use __mid__ sentence
````

- Bulleted items
  - Indented bulleted items
  - You can have as many as you want
    - Really as many as you want

## Pandas DataFrame (`df`)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Expand To See Links to Chapter in the book `Python for DataScience`
- [Chapter on Pandas: DataFrames](https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/dataframe.html)
:::

What is a pandas dataFrame? We can read the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydf.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe). I also like the video in [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python).

Use the Import Packages and Load df for the Code that follows.

## Import Packages
````{}
import `library` as `alias`
````

```{.python filename="Import Libraries"}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

from IPython.display import Markdown
from IPython.display import display
```

## Load Data
```{}
df = pd.read_csv(`url` or `file_path`)
```

```{.python filename="Load Data"}
#| label: project data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Include and execute your code here
url = "https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Data Frames come with attributes and built-in functions that can help us get a feel for our df.

Run the code below one at a time (or use other functions of your choice) to explore the `names` df. What do you learn?

```{.python filename=".columns"}
df.columns
```
```{.python filename=".shape"}
df.shape
```
```{.python filename=".size"}
df.size
```
```{.python filename=".head()"}
df.head()
```
```{.python filename=".describe()"}
df.describe()
```

# Getting started with Plotly Express

[Plotly Express](/Course%20Materials/plotly_express.qmd)

<!-- ## Prove Activity - Explore Pandas and the Data

**1. How many `.unique()` names does the `names` dataframe contain?** <br>
_Work with a partner to find the answer. You might want to look at this [pandas cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydf.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)._

::: {.callout-tip title="Hint" collapse="true"}
1. Pull the name column out as a series
1. Use the pandas unique function `pd.unique()`
1. Find the size of the series
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To See An Example Solution
```{.python}
pd.unique(df.name)
```
:::

**2. What is the range of years in the `names` dataframe?** <br>
_Again, work with a partner and use the pandas cheat sheet._

::: {.callout-tip title="Hint" collapse="true"}
1. Pull the year column out as a series
1. Find the max
1. Find the min
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To See An Example Solution
```{.python}
pd.unique(df.year).min()
pd.unique(df.year).max()
pd.unique(df.year).size
```
:::

**3. How would you `.query()` for the `name` John?** <br>

::: {.callout-tip title="Hint" collapse="true"}
1. `pd.query()` the name when it is equal to `==` John
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To See An Example Solution
```{.python}
df.query('name == "John"')
pd.unique(df.query('name == "John"'))
```
:::

**4. What is the range of years in the `names df` for the `name` John?** <br>

::: {.callout-tip title="Hint" collapse="true"}
1. Use your combined knowledge to `.query()`
1. and to find the `.max()` and `.min()`
1. and `.size()` for a particular `name`
:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To See An Example Solution
```{.python}
pd.unique(df.query('name == "John"').year).min()
pd.unique(df.query('name == "John"').year).max()
pd.unique(df.query('name == "John"').year).size
```
:::

**5. How would you query for multiple names in a `df`?** <br>

::: {.callout-tip title="Hint" collapse="true"}
1. Similar to what you did above for a single name
1. Now one way is to use the `|` OR bar
1. Another way is to use `in` a `[]` List
:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To See An Example Solution
```{.python}
#note you can not use pd.unique() with multiple names
df.query('name == "John" | name == "Peter"')
df.query('name in ["John","Peter","Bob"]')
```
